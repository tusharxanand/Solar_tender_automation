Solar Tender Details - Web scraping Project

Source - Mercom India Solar Tender Archive

The code seems to be a web scraper that extracts data from the website mercomindia.com for solar tenders and auctions, saves the links to an Excel file, and then uses the links to extract headline and date information from each article on the website. The date extraction uses the parsedatetime library to parse the date from the text of the article. Finally, the extracted data is saved to another Excel file.
